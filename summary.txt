NOTE: DFS and BFS include the 1.5 cost for going over turfs because, to my understanding, it's only
the search algorithm that ignores path costs, and this summary file is asking for the actual cost of
the path. If we were to ask for the PATH COST of these two algorithms WITHOUT turf's 1.5 cost, then
the "Number of Nodes in Path" value would be their cost (each step only costs 1, thus the number of
nodes in the path would be the same as the cost of the path).
